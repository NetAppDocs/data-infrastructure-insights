Easily keep tabs on the health of your infrastructure with Data Infrastructure Insights' health monitoring.

== Configure Monitors to watch infrastructure health

When creating a monitor for an infrastructure object, you can choose whether to include alerts from the monitor in the infrastructure health calculations. At the bottom of the screen, expand the Advanced Configuration and select to _Include in Infrastructure Health Calculation_.

== Monitor your infrastructure health

Navigate to Observability > Analyze and select Infrastructure Health for an overview of your system health. Set  filters at the top to narrow down the focus of your investigation.

By default, health scores are grouped by data center; you can select the grouping that works best for your session.

== Health scores explained

Scores are presented on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being at full health. Monitored infrastructure objects currently or recently experiencing issues will lower this score according to the following weighted averages:

Components, Performance, or Capacity: 30% each
Configuration: 10%

Alerts impact scores, such that Critical alerts drop the health score by the full category weight, and warning alerts drop the score by half the category weight.

If any categories are not reporting, the weighted average will adjust accordingly. 

For example, 1 critical alert on Components (-30) and 1 warning alert on Performance (50% of 30 = -15) yield a health score of 55 (100 minus 45). 

When alerts are resolved, these health score reductions gradually fade, and the score fully recovers within 2 hours.
