Data Infrastructure Insights now gives you greater control over access to the dashboards you create. You choose who can modify your graphs. You control exposure to potentially sensitive information. Keeping a dashboard Private allows you to finalize your visualizations until they are ready to be consumed by others in your organization.

By default, when you create a new dashboard, that dashboard is only visible to you, the creator. No other user can see or modify the dashboard.

When you have finalized your dashboard, you may choose to allow others in your organization to view it. To share a dashboard, in the dashboard list, select the _Share_ from the right-hand menu.

You can choose to share the dashboard to Everyone or to select users, with either Edit or Read-Only permissions.
