[.lead]
This data collector supports inventory and performance collection from Google NetApp Cloud Volumes cloud platform configurations. This collector will seek to discover all the compute resources within all the Projects within one Google organization. If you have multiple Google organizations you want to discover with Data Infrastructure Insights, you will want to deploy one Data Infrastructure Insights collector per organization. 

== Service Account Requirements

* You must create a service account by following the instructions in link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts[Creating/Managing Service Accounts]. Such service account is identified by a unique ID, known as its _clientId_, which will be used as a username. 
* Additionally, create a service account key by following the instructions in link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys[Creating/Managing Service Account Keys]. This key can be downloaded as a json file, whose content will be used as a password.
* The service account must be scoped for _compute.readonly_, _monitoring.read_, and _cloud-platform_.

|Field|Description
|Inventory Poll Interval (min) |Default is 60 minutes

|Use AU Proxy for REST API calls|This checkbox will cause the collector to use the same proxy as the AU the collector lives on. This is not enabled by default - which means the collector will attempt to send HTTPS API calls directly to Google.
|Label Keys and Values on which to Filter VMs|Click *+ Filter Label* to choose which VMs (and associated disks) to include/exclude by filtering for keys and values that match keys and values of labels on the VM. Label Key is required, Label Value is optional. When Label Value is empty, the VM is filtered as long as it matches the Label Key.

|Performance Poll Interval (sec)|Default is 300 seconds
