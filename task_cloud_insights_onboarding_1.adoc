Before you can start working with Data Infrastructure Insights, you must sign up on the *NetApp Console* portal. If you already have a NetApp Console login, you can start a free trial of Data Infrastructure Insights with a few quick steps.

== Creating your NetApp Console account

To get started with NetApp's cloud services, go to link:https://console.netapp.com/[*NetApp Console*^] and click *Sign Up*.

* Enter a valid business email address and choose a password.
* Enter your company name, and your full name.
* Accept the terms and conditions and select *Continue*.
* Console will walk you through getting started.



=== What if I already have a NetApp Console login?

Once you have a NetApp Console account, simply choose *Log In* on the link:https://console.netapp.com/[*NetApp Console*^] portal page.

Select your Organization from the drop-down at the top of the screen.

From the main menu in the upper-left, select *Governance > Data Infrastructure Insights*.

== Starting your Data Infrastructure Insights free trial

If this is your first time logging in to Data Infrastructure Insights, read about everything Data Infrastructure Insights has to offer, and when you are ready to get started, select *Start 30-day free trial*. Choose the region in which to host your tenant, and follow any other prompts.


== Begin onboarding

Console informs you when your Data Infrastructure Insights (DII) tenant is ready for onboarding. Select the *Start onboarding* button to set up your tenant. 

If at any time you leave the onboarding process before it is complete, simply log back in to Console to *Finish onboarding*.


== You're ready to go!

Once onboarding is complete, Console informs you that your tenant is ready for use. Select *Launch Data Infrastructure Insights* to begin. Note that some data will be available for immediate use (inventory, etc.), while other data may take time to acquire in order to be meaningful (performance monitoring, etc.). 



== Logging Out


To log out of Data Infrastructure Insights, click your User Name in the upper right corner of the screen and select *Log Out*. You will be taken back to the Console sign-in screen.

NOTE: Logging out of Data Infrastructure Insights logs you out of Console. You will also be logged out of other NetApp Cloud services that use the Console sign-in.


=== Inactivity Timeout

By default, Console will log a user out if there is no activity for six hours (360 minutes). Regardless of activity, users will be logged out after seven days.
