== Before using the AI Assistant

* This experimental AI Assistant is designed to assist you, and while it strives for accuracy, we recommend you always verify its outputs with human oversight for best results.  * This AI Assistant is powered by third-party LLMs. 
* For safety and privacy of you and your colleagues, please do not input personally identifiable information (PII). 
* To help keep your data secure, we ask that you do not enter sensitive or confidential information.
* NetApp will use your inputs and the AI Assistant outputs to test and improve the functionality of the AI Assistant, all subject to the link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/71584-netapp-data-processing-addendum.pdf[NetApp Data Processing Addendum] and the link:https://www.netapp.com/company/legal/privacy-policy/[NetApp Privacy Policy]. 


== What can the AI Assistant do for me?

=== Data Analysis

The DII AI Assistant can help you analyze where you might have anomalies in your data. To do this effectively, I need to understand what specific data you're interested in examining for anomalies.

The DII system contains various types of data, including:

* Asset telemetry (hosts, storage, VMs, etc.)
* Datalake measurements (Kubernetes, NetApp, VMware metrics)
* Logs from different systems
* Alerts that may indicate anomalies

To provide a meaningful analysis, provide the Assistant with specific information about:

* The type of data you want to analyze (e.g., specific assets, metrics, or systems),
* The timeframe you're interested in, and
* Any specific issue types you're concerned about (performance issues, capacity problems, errors, etc.)

=== Troubleshoot issues

The AI Assistant can help troubleshoot data center issues by leveraging DII (Data Infrastructure Insights) tools and data repositories. Here's what the Assistant can do:

* *Investigate System Logs* - Query various log types (EMS logs, VMware events, Kubernetes events, and more) to identify error messages, warnings, and root causes of problems.

* *Analyze Performance Metrics* - Retrieve performance data from the datalake to identify bottlenecks, resource constraints, and unusual patterns across your infrastructure.

* *Review Active Alerts* - Examine current and historical alerts to understand what issues have been detected by monitoring systems and correlate them with potential root causes.

* *Examine Asset Information* - Gather detailed configuration and status information about specific infrastructure components, including hosts, storage systems, VMs, and applications.

* *Monitor Resource Utilization* - Track CPU, memory, disk, and network usage across your environment to identify resource constraints and capacity issues.

* *Track Changes* - Review change logs to correlate issues with recent modifications and identify patterns in infrastructure changes.

To enable the Assistant to troubleshoot effectively, provide the following information:

* The specific issue you're experiencing and its symptoms
* Which systems or components are affected
* Any error messages or alerts you've observed
* When the problem started occurring
* Any recent changes to your environment
* Expected behavior versus actual behavior

With these details, the Assistant can query the appropriate data sources and provide targeted insights to help resolve your issue.
