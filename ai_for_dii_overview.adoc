== The AI Assistant works with you

The DII AI Assistant can help you answer questions about your IT Infrastructure's data. To do this effectively, it needs to understand your request as well as what specific data is required in order to respond to your request. 

The DII system contains various types of data, including:

* Asset telemetry (hosts, storage, VMs, etc.)
* Datalake metrics (Kubernetes, NetApp Storage, VMware)
* Logs from different systems
* Alerts that may indicate anomalies

For the best experience, provide the Assistant with specific information about:

* The type of data you want to analyze (e.g., specific assets, metrics, or systems),
* The timeframe you're interested in, and
* Any specific issue types you're concerned about (performance issues, capacity problems, errors, etc.)
