== Meet your infrastructure's new intelligent partner

The AI Assistant transforms how you interact with your data, turning complex queries into simple conversations. Instantly uncover hidden patterns, accelerate troubleshooting, and make data-driven decisions with confidence. Get instant answers to questions like:

* How can I configure a monitor to alert for persistent unacceptable latency?
* What are the top storage pools with the highest utilization in the environment?
* How many alerts were generated in the last hour?
* What are the most common types of logs being collected?
* Which hosts are experiencing the highest CPU utilization?
* What asset types are available for monitoring in the environment?
* Are there any critical alerts currently active?
* What's the overall health status of the storage systems?
* Which virtual machines are consuming the most memory?
* What are the current network performance metrics across the infrastructure?
* How many monitors are configured in the system?


== Before using the AI Assistant

* The AI Assistant is designed to assist you. While it strives for accuracy, it is strongly recommended to verify its outputs with human oversight for best results. 
* For safety and privacy of you and your colleagues, please do not input personally identifiable information (PII). 
* To help keep your data secure, do not enter sensitive or confidential information.

== The AI Assistant works with you

The DII AI Assistant can help you answer questions about your IT Infrastructure's data. To do this effectively, it needs to understand what specific data you're interested in examining for anomalies.

The DII system contains various types of data, including:

* Asset telemetry (hosts, storage, VMs, etc.)
* Datalake measurements (Kubernetes, NetApp, VMware metrics)
* Logs from different systems
* Alerts that may indicate anomalies

To provide a meaningful analysis, provide the Assistant with specific information about:

* The type of data you want to analyze (e.g., specific assets, metrics, or systems),
* The timeframe you're interested in, and
* Any specific issue types you're concerned about (performance issues, capacity problems, errors, etc.)

=== Troubleshoot issues

The AI Assistant can help troubleshoot data center issues by leveraging DII (Data Infrastructure Insights) tools and data repositories. Here's what the Assistant can do:

* *Investigate System Logs* - Query various log types (EMS logs, VMware events, Kubernetes events, and more) to identify error messages, warnings, and root causes of problems.

* *Analyze Performance Metrics* - Retrieve performance data to identify bottlenecks, resource constraints, and unusual patterns across your infrastructure.

* *Review Active Alerts* - Examine current and historical alerts to understand what issues have been detected by monitoring systems and correlate them with potential root causes.

* *Examine Asset Information* - Gather detailed configuration and status information about specific infrastructure components, including hosts, storage systems, VMs, and applications.

* *Monitor Resource Utilization* - Track CPU, memory, disk, and network usage across your environment to identify resource constraints and capacity issues.

* *Track Changes* - Review change logs to correlate issues with recent modifications and identify patterns in infrastructure changes.

To enable the Assistant to troubleshoot effectively, provide the following information:

* The specific issue you're experiencing and its symptoms
* Which systems or components are affected
* Any error messages or alerts you've observed
* When the problem started occurring
* Any recent changes to your environment
* Expected behavior versus actual behavior

With these details, the Assistant can query the appropriate data sources and provide targeted insights to help resolve your issue.
