[.lead]
Asset pages summarize the current status of an asset and contain links to additional information about the asset and its related assets.

Landing pages give you a single-page view of the object, with Summary, Performance, and Related Resource information.

=== Summary Section

At the top of a landing page is the expandible Summary section, which includes several sparkline graphs displaying recent data trends for things like throughput or latency, as well as object information and attributes, user data including annotations (if any), and any alerts that may be happening related to the object.


=== Performance Section

The Performance Section (formerly known as the Expert View section) displays performance data for the object. Select _Settings_ to add additional charts to the display like Throughput or Capacity, o select correlated or contributing resources to chart their data alongside the object's. Devices that may potentially be causing contention will be listed in the Performance section.

The Expert View section of an asset page enables you to view a performance sample for the base asset based on any number of applicable metrics in context with a chosen time period in the performance chart and any assets related to it.  The data in the charts refreshes automatically as data collectors poll and updated data is acquired.

You can select the metrics you want to view in the performance chart for the time period selected. Click on the _Display Metrics_ drop-down and choose from the metrics listed.


=== Additional Resources Section

The Additional Resources section displays tables of data for resources related to the current object type. You can expand and collapse these tables in order to focus on specific resources.

=== Add Custom Widgets

You can add your own widgets to any asset page.  Widgets you add will appear on asset pages for all objects of that type. For example, adding a custom widget to a storage asset page will display that widget on asset pages for all storage assets.

Custom widgets are placed at the bottom of a landing page, below the Performance and Resource sections.



== Types of Asset Pages

Data Infrastructure Insights provides asset pages for the following assets:


* Virtual machine
* Storage Virtual Machine (SVM)
* Volume
* Internal volume
* Host (including Hypervisor)
* Storage pool
* Storage
* Datastore
* Application
* Storage node
* Qtree
* Disk
* VMDK
* Port
* Switch
* Fabric
* Host
* Zone


== Changing the Time Range of Displayed Data

By default, an asset page displays the last 24 hours of data; however, you can change the segment of data displayed by selecting another fixed time range or a custom range of time to view less or more data.

You can change the time segment of displayed data by using an option that is located on every asset page, regardless of asset type. To change the time range, click the displayed time range in the top bar and choose from among the following time segments:

* Last 15 Minutes
* Last 30 Minutes
* Last 60 Minutes
* Last 2 Hours
* Last 3 Hours (this is the default)
* Last 6 Hours
* Last 12 Hours
* Last 24 Hours
* Last 2 Days
* Last 3 Days
* Last 7 Days
* Last 14 Days
* Last 30 Days
* Custom time range

The Custom time range allows you to select up to 31 consecutive days. You can also set the Start Time and End Time of day for this range. The default Start Time is 12:00 AM on the first day selected and the default End Time is 11:59 PM on the last day selected. Clicking Apply will apply the custom time range to the asset page.

The information in an asset page summary section, as well as in any tables or custom widgets on the page, refreshes automatically based on the selected time range. The current refresh rate is displayed in the upper-right corner of the Summary section as well as on any relevant tables or widgets on the page.
