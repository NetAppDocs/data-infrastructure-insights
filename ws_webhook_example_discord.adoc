Webhooks allow users to send alert notifications to various applications using a customized webhook channel. This page provides an example for setting up webhooks for Discord.

NOTE: This page refers to third-party instructions, which care subject to change. Refer to the link:https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks[Discord documentation] for the most up-to-date information. 

== Discord Setup:

* In Discord, select the Server, under Text Channels, select Edit Channel (gear icon)

* Select *Integrations > View Webhooks* and click *New Webhook*


* Copy the Webhook URL. You will need to paste this into the Workload Security webhook configuration.


== Create Workload Security Webhook:


. Navigate to Admin > Notifications and select the _Workload Security Webhooks_ tab. Click '+ Webhook' to create a new webhook.

. Give the webhook a meaningful Name. 

. In the _Template Type_ drop-down, select *Discord*.

. Paste the Discord URL from above into the _URL_ field.

In order to test the webhook, temporarily replace the URL value in the message body with any valid URL (such as _https://netapp.com_) then click the _Test Webhook_ button. Discord requires that a valid URL be supplied in order for Test Webhook functionality to work. 

Be sure to set the message body back once the test completes. 

== Notifications via Webhook

To notify on events via webhook, navigate to _Workload Security > Policies_. Click on _+Attack Policy_ or  _+Warning Policy_.

* Enter a meaningful policy name.

* Select the required Attack Type(s), Devices to which policy should be attached, and required Actions.

* Under the _Webhooks Notifications_ dropdown, select the required Discord webhooks and save.

Note: Webhooks can also be attached to existing policies by editing them.
