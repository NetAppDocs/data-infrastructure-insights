.Steps

* Navigate to *Observability > Explore -> +New Metric Query*.
* Select _Storage_ from the drop down.
* Click the gear and add _isActive_ as a column.
+
Rows showing a Check are active. "X" indicates inactive devices.


To remove inactive devices, simply select the devices to remove and in the *Bulk Actions* drop-down, select _Delete Inactive Devices_.
