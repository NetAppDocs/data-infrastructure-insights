= Querying Assets and Metrics

[.lead]
Query your infrastructure's physical and virtual assets to monitor performance, troubleshoot issues, and perform granular searches based on custom criteria like annotations. Data Infrastructure Insights enables queries across diverse asset types—from storage arrays and hosts to applications and virtual machines—along with integration metrics from Kubernetes, Docker, and ONTAP Advanced Data for comprehensive visibility. 

Note that annotation rules, which automatically assign annotations to assets, require a query that has been shared with everyone. See below for more on sharing queries.

You can query the physical or virtual inventory assets (and their associated metrics) on your tenant, or the metrics provided with integration such as Kubernetes or ONTAP Advanced Data.

== Inventory Assets

All inventory (also called infrastructure) asset types (storage, switch, VM, Application, etc.) can be used in queries, dashboard widgets, and customized asset landing pages. The fields and counters available for filters, expressions, and display will vary among asset types.

== Integration Metrics

In addition to querying for inventory assets and their associated performance metrics, you can query for *integration data* metrics as well, such as those generated by Kubernetes or Docker, or provided with ONTAP Advanced Metrics.

== Sharing Queries

Control access to your queries by choosing who can view and edit them. By default, new queries are private and visible only to you, and you can choose to share them with specific users or your entire organization with flexible permission levels (Read-Only or Edit).

You can choose to share the query to Everyone or to select users, with either Edit or Read-Only permissions. 

NOTE: Users with Account Owner permission can see all queries, regardless of privacy setting.
