== Checklist and Video Tutorials

The *Startup Checklist* displayed on your Data Infrastructure Insights tenant contains a list of several useful tasks and concepts. Selecting an item in the checklist takes you to the appropriate Data Infrastructure Insights page for that concept. For example, clicking on the _Create a Dashboard_ item opens the Data Infrastructure Insights *Dashboards* page.

At the top of the page is a link to a video tutorial showing how to create a dashboard. You can view the video as many times as you like until you click the _Got it! Don't Show This Again_ link for that video. The video is available every time you go to the Dashboards page, until you dismiss it.

After watching the video at least once, the _Create a Dashboard_ item in the checklist is checked off, indicating that you have completed the tutorial. You can then proceed to the next tutorial.

NOTE: You can view the tutorials in any order you like, as many times as you like until dismissed. 

=== Dismissing the Checklist

The Startup Checklist is displayed until you click the _Don't Show This Again_ link at the bottom of the checklist. Even after dismissing the checklist, the tutorials are still available on each appropriate Data Infrastructure Insights page until you dismiss each one from the message header bar.
